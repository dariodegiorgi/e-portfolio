											The use of the tool tracert or traceroute. This tool uses the Time To Live (TTL), the hop and the asterisk, the Time To Live (TTL) allows us to give the lifetime, in order to determine the intermediate routers between the source and the destination. The hop allows us to check each router transition and the asterisk tells us the timeout of the command and that the router does not respond to the received packet, it is possible that the blocking is done at the firewall level, it is possible a traceroute display incomplete data and it's not accurate enough (CySecBot, 2018).

Good afternoon Dario,<br>
</p>
										<p>


You are correct, data and files are far more accessible these days, which is excellent if you have good intentions. However, as you have said, it leaves you more susceptible to a varied level of attacks. Scarily though, you may be attacked with a ransomware attack before you receive a phishing email, it is essentially pot luck.

</p>
										<p>

A survey that was asked back in 2019/8/7/6 asked a collection of companies their frequency of attacks, the types and severity. In terms of attacks, 80% of businesses and 81% of charities reported that phishing attacks were the most frequent, with the second most seen being impersonation emails at a rate of 20% and 28% respectively (Gov.uk, 2019). This is a massive step in the frequencies between the two which shows that the easiest method is seen as the best, which is further backed up by the fact that phishing has been named the most common attack in 2019. It was reported that in 2018, 83% of the people that were asked experienced this kind of attack, which has also shown an upward trend from the years previously (Graham, 2019).

</p>
										<p>

In regards to Bitcoin, although it is a good idea in theory because it is easy to use, it is portable, and it is VERY secure, it also has its downsides. At the end of 2020 bordering 2021, a man named Stefan Thomas lost the password to his Bitcoin wallet, which currently totals £175 million (Neate, 2021). Should he guess the last two attempts incorrectly, he will lose the entire fortune. So yes, it is secure but in the instance that a company loses its password, because we all know this does happen, they could lose access to their entire banking system. So in light of that, I do not believe a company should use cryptocurrencies as its methods of payment.

Cryptocurrency's potential is undoubtedly exciting and promising either for the bank sector or for humankind as a whole. On the other hand, people nowadays confuse Bitcoin with the technology that underlies, the so-called Blockchain. Bitcoin is the use of Blockchain in order to transfer value (Sinha et al., 2019). As has already mentioned, there are significant advantages to this newly established technology. This tool claims to upgrade security and efficiency (i.e. operational costs) of financial transactions adding transparency and speed at the same time.
</p>
										<p>
The benefits and the revolution that inherently Bitcoin embodies, are perceived as ambiguous from the Bank Industry. On the one hand, the apparent advantages already mentioned and on the other hand, an existential threat for the whole industry. To cope with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, central bankers have already considered the creation of Central Bank Digital Currencies, intending to displace Bitcoin ( Roubini, 2019).
</p>
										<p>
According to the same article, this solution would not come without consequences in the current fractional-reserve system. The private banks, in that case, would become obsolete and purposeless because the transactions would be accomplished without intermediaries and fees.
</p>
										<p>
In the final analysis, the Blockchain potential in transactions seems to be very promising for individuals and organizations, but at the same time, some many factors and obstacles have to be assessed before we proceed to a digital transformation of value.
</p>

Following Spiros’s observation over the endangered sustainability of the current banking system from the use of cryptocurrencies, I would like to add an overview of cryptocurrency crime for 2019-2020.
</p>
										<p>
Furthermore, according to Cipher Trace’s report about cryptocurrency crime and anti-money laundering (Julio, 2021) in its exit scam, the Ponzi scheme PlusToken netted $2.9 billion in 2019, 64 per cent of the cybercrime value of the year. In 2020, WoToken, a related scheme administered by several of the criminals as PlusToken, defrauded investors in its exit scam of $1.1 billion, 58 per cent of the cybercrime value of 2020. Although the major percentage of fraud saw a substantial decline, it also accounted for 73 per cent of the overall crime in 2020.
</p>
										<p>
Additionally, as we notice a substantial reduction of cryptocurrency crime for 2020, Decentralized Finance attacks are marked as a significant risk vector for fraud and money laundering, highlighting KuCoin centralized exchange, with hackers stealing 281 million $ from the Singaporean exchange (Manoylov, 2021).
</p>
										<p>
Moreover, referring to Kfir (2020), there are growing doubts about terrorists using cryptocurrency for the funding of their activities by abusing the aspect of untraceability of cryptocurrencies.
</p>
										<p>
Concluding, as blockchain seems promising on numerous aspects of cybersecurity, cryptocurrencies will remain a target for frauds and money laundering technics.
</p>

											<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h3>

										<p>
											When the Internet arrived about 38 years ago and we went from physical to virtual data storage, it is impossible to guarantee data security fully. Still, we can limit leaks and ensure maximum protection against malicious people wanting to steal your data or harm computer resources (VanSyckel, 2018).
</p>
										<p>
Securing an IT environment is essential, but it is vital to find the right balance between security and network fluidity. An environment that is too secure by a firewall, using packet inspection tools, can reduce network performance.
</p>
										<p>
Czeska I agree and disagree with your comment because I find it relevant to mention these statistics concerning phishing, as it is relatively easy to do and beneficial, which would logically explain the statistics you say, nevertheless I'm afraid I have to disagree with your remark about cryptocurrency (Stanley, 2021) because if a person has a private key, they can get their money back at any time, but that's not the point, the purpose of the crypto-money theme is the economic benefits and the enhanced security with this technology, even if, as Spiros mentions, if we move towards this technology, it could have severe consequences in today's economy (Anagnostopoulos, 2021).
</p>
										<p>
Encryption is a necessary process in computing, whether on a wired or wireless network, to avoid sending data unencrypted and to avoid a man in the middle. Still, if the different systems are not up to date, this can pose a risk as well, because obsolete software or systems can be a target for a cyber-attack. Even if we are relatively well protected, it is possible to be attacked. That is why intrusion detection is also recommended to prevent a potential attack and be prepared to counter it (Anderson, 2008).
</p>
										<p>
In conclusion, we have tried to understand the different ways and tools that a cyber-criminal has to harm a company, and there are no miracle solutions to be completely bulletproof, as cyber-attacks evolve over time and are increasingly innovative and therefore cybersecurity must develop with them as well.
