											During this module, I first learned about the kali Linux operating system, this OS which has a multitude of components allowing to scan and attack any device. I was very interested in this module because of its practical side, because we could simulate a website as if it was a company, so we could build the client/company side of the attack and also be part of the hacker side, which was very interesting for me. The practical part proposed in this module allowed us first of all to check the network basics during the scan and then to enter more into the heart of the matter. The scanning tools will enable us to see how we can attack the other team and then use tools to do damage (e.g. brute force on a form request). 
I think it's a good thing to put ourselves in an actual situation during this module because it gives you a practical aspect which is not necessarily always the case when you're studying. The fact that I can put theory into practice was something I enjoyed.
Apart from this practical side which interested me a lot, we also made several exchanges during the collaborative forums by analyzing different subjects, highlighting the computer vulnerabilities of companies or environments. The arguments in the forums allowed us to have several points of view, and that is enriching. Some topics were exciting, such as "compromising a medical mannequin" which made me realize how vital it is to put in place good security procedures, especially for a subject as sensitive as the medical environment. 
Another new experience during this module was the group work we had to do, which overall went well. Still, as it was something new, there were some gaps in our group work, especially in terms of organization, which is not always easy in online courses, as everyone has their schedule. It would have been better to have weekly meetings to make decisions and distribute tasks because we lost time exchanging messages. It would have been more efficient. The exchange of ideas was not often taken into account by classmates, either mine or others. The coordination with the "a" team when we had to do the website scans was laborious, as some people had not followed the AWS site procedure thoroughly, which does not make the work easier for the practical part of the module. Generally speaking, during group work, we always helped each other. When someone made a mistake, we did not hesitate to reframe the subject to make the necessary corrections.

											I think that the sharing of ideas is essential when we are working as a team, the efficiency in which we were able to do the work, especially in respecting the time to submit the work, we were even in advance, and I think it’s a good thing. Let us continue to help each other when we are not sure or have questions about a topic. I shared my opinion about the homogeneity of the final rendering and tried to propose to make the work more critically oriented.
I have tried to give my point of view on each of the themes, not only on the technical subjects, we have discussed but also on the organizational side. I always argue my answers if I disagree with my classmates.
I'm a fairly open person, and I respect other people's ideas, but that doesn't mean I'm always going to agree with other people's opinions, I put my point of view and then give my arguments. When the tasks were distributed to the groups, I tried to do my best to deliver the work as quickly as possible so that we could have more time in the end to make the final corrections.
I met the deadline we gave ourselves to do my part of the job. As I was in charge of the website on AWS, I was always cooperative with my team and the team opposite. It wasn't always easy when I had to do the configuration on the AWS site, because sometimes there were problems, especially when setting up the roles in AWS with the key pair, because it didn't work at first. I do not hesitate to give a hand even to people having problems on AWS. I was very responsive when we communicated during the day about the project.
I think it’s challenging to agree on everything when we need to do a work for the group, specially when we are 6 people in the group, there is always one or two people left over or one or two people who are taking the lead, I consider myself being between them.
I didn't hesitate to say if a classmate was out of line when assigning tasks in group work, I think you also need to be diplomatic when working in a group to don't get upset about things that may not be so important. I think we didn't brainstorm enough about the assignments, it would have been effective to exchange ideas, opinions and criticism.

When we work in a group, we divide the tasks somewhat is important and ensures a quick and complete performance. When a fellow student is working on his own or not communicating, I have tried to encourage him instead of shutting him out. I think it is essential to trust the person you are working with while controlling the final output.

I learned a lot about myself during the group work, but also about my colleagues. I can see that the advice and remarks that my colleagues have made allow us to move forward and progress. Participation and motivation within the group are fundamental elements for us to succeed in group work.

I tried to do my best to listening to others, supporting classmates who are having some troubles, having original ideas and being efficient. I think it is still necessary to improve the organization of the group and perhaps divide up tasks such as: finalizing the work, turnitin the work, review the work.
