											<h2>The importance of a postgraduate degree in the Computer Science field</h2>

											People and businesses become dependent on computers, internet access, and data sharing. These needs become targets for Cybercriminals over time. Cyber Security is beginning to take an essential place in businesses and other organizations and decrease the risk of cyber-attacks. Cyber Security can include several elements, and attacks generally depend on the situation in which one or the company finds itself (Albladi & Weir 2020).
										</p>
										<p>
											One of the different aspects to adopt would be implementing a security layer during software or website development. If vulnerabilities are detected, there will be a risk of delivering patches after production. Network infrastructure can also be a source of exposure. A complete analysis and testing are a good practice to limit an infrastructure's security risks if they are implementation issues. The human aspect also needs to be considered when we talk about IT vulnerabilities. It is advisable to train company employees to avoid security breaches. Instead of exploiting technical loopholes to reach their victims, cybercriminals can use tools to lure users (Craigen et al. 2014). In the same vein, the legal aspect is essential when discussing cybersecurity. Depending on which jurisdiction we find ourselves under, there are rules to follow, especially concerning the EU; the establishment of GDPR makes it possible to regulate this jurisdiction (Markopoulou et al. 2019).
										</p>
										<p>
											A person working in cybersecurity must understand the methodologies of defense through different tools to protect people or the organization's integrity. The further we move forward in time, the more we use information technology to make our daily tasks more comfortable, no matter what field you are in at the moment. 
As an example, I currently work in a bank in Geneva, and we recently suffered a DDOS attack, which resulted in the unavailability of internet access for several hours. The company lost a lot of money due to this attack, and we could have prevented this with better protection. The problem was in detecting the threat, which took an enormous amount of time. The network slowdowns were significant. Setting up backup network routing took far too long to activate. With a DDOS attack, there is no time to think about the action plan; it must be defined in advance. Cybercrime is a scourge in today's world.

										</p>
										<p>
											Sarker et al. (2020: 1) states that:
 “Cybercrime and attacks can cause devastating financial losses and affect organizations and individuals as well. It’s estimated that a data breach costs 8.19 million USD for the United States and 3.9 million USD on an average, and the annual cost to the global economy from cybercrime is 400 billion USD.”

										</p>
										<p>
											This degree will not only allow the adoption of these right defense methodologies. Still, it will be a significant asset in the world of work, especially in Europe, as employers are particularly demanding in terms of qualifications not only on a professional level but also personally, which allows us to contribute to a better digital world. A degree in cybersecurity helps to overcome this type of situation and reduces the risk of cyberattacks. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Besides, acquiring this type of skill presents many opportunities. We have many possibilities to implement acceptable practices in cybersecurity; the topic of these last couple of years would be the dominance of cryptocurrency. We are not going into detail, but one of the most critical arguments of this technology is to provide "secure" transactions, which is paradoxical because it is difficult to control. Data protection is not just a company's infrastructure defense but an earth-wide cyber defense. Cryptocurrency decentralization is an ideal tool for cybercriminals. Cybercriminals can hack and steal funds from cryptocurrency trading platforms. In cases of ransomware attacks, cryptocurrency is now the most favored type of exchange. Incidents of ransomware typically have a common thread. When asking for ransom in digital currencies, Cybercriminals may mask their real identities (Anon, 2019).
										</p>
										<p>
											In the world of finance, more and more banks want to hire people specialized in cybersecurity. Attacks are multiplying and becoming more sophisticated (Rastogi & Nygard, 2017). Unfortunately, the departments in the financial world that deal with cybersecurity always seem to be lagging. Developing knowledge on this subject allows a team of bankers, scientists, compliance, data analysts, and crypto specialists to join forces to make a company or a product inviolable. Swiss banking security is a globally recognized asset, and cybersecurity skills will provide better protection for the company I work with today. It helps inspire confidence among people and maintain a reputation for safety and trust in Swiss banking.
