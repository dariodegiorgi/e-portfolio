Case Study: Accuracy of information

</h3>
										</header>

										<p>
											
Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.

Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”

Ethical Concerns

Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?
Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?
Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?
If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?

										Abi is in a very difficult position here; it is clear that data can influence a product.

When collecting data on a product, one's interests should be set aside and, as far as possible, an analyst should be as impartial as possible, otherwise, the results will be meaningless.

According to the National Committee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the Humanities (NESH), the best way to do ethical research is to provide data that meets ethical standards. These standards will aim to respect scientific research by providing accurate, adequate and relevant results. The results of the research should not give a distorted picture of reality.

There is also a law on ethics and integrity in research, which allows public and private organisations to respect ethical standards. It is difficult to distinguish clearly between law and ethics, as they are both different. Ethical standards will rather be considered as a guideline to be followed, they will advise the researcher, point him in the right direction and warn him of dangers.

Therefore, research ethics is mainly self-regulated, researchers and research institutions have to take their responsibilities in terms of ethics. If this freedom and responsibility do not exist, research ethics is of little use (NESH, 2019).

										Summary Post
									</p>
									<p>
										The manipulation of the result of a search analysis can make us ask on a larger level many questions in terms of ethics. Ethics can be important, both at the client and employee level.

Ethics is undoubtedly very important within a company, as employees (73%) feel that they will consider the values of a company when looking for a job. Some 83% of employees would like to be paid less and work for a company with ethical values, rather than work for a company with no ethics (WGU, 2021).

When a company delivers accurate and consistent results, ethics and truthfulness can give the company a good reputation and build loyalty to its customers. Companies build their reputations and relationships with customers by benefiting from their trust, which uses their products, in our example the product named "Whizzz". If the data collected by the product is not accurate, the trust between the company and the customer will be broken.

Even if private companies are not accountable to their various shareholders, they stand to gain if they have robust moral codes and fair figures. Fairness in results and an ethical approach will overall benefit the company, as customers will make purchasing decisions based on their ethical perceptions of the value of a company (Gartenstein, N.D).
