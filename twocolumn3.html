											During the collaborative discussion we discuss some different subject, one of them was the article named “compromising a medical Mannequin”, the medical world is a sensitive environment, and protection against cyber-attacks must be implemented. Therefore, the security breaches in this article are alarming.
In this post, I will highlight two security breaches detected during the brute force attack. To avoid undergoing such attacks, it is preferable to adopt some good practices, a solution to limit the attacks of type brute force, would be as the company Varonis mentions it, to deactivate the function "WPS" on the routers, given that WPS is used to recover the lost passwords, this tool will thus make it possible to give the complete access to the hacker, as shown in figure 8 in the reaver result (the link to the article can be found on the left of the website).
Varonis further advises against using a weak password for wi-fi since the WPA2 weakness allows a brute force attack to be used to obtain the password. It is also highly suggested to use a unique password for wi-fi access that is not identical to the ID. (Kinzie, N.D).
To the extent feasible, on-premise technologies should be used to avoid leakage to the outside world. Setting up a redundancy architecture that doubles bandwidth capacity, isolates the network and data centers, and has a mirror effect in the event of a network failover is a good solution to prevent DDoS assaults.
Stress tests may also be scheduled to see if a firm is prepared to withstand a DDoS attack. This sort of test may be used to determine if traffic monitoring and filtering is successful, as well as how long it takes to defend themselves. (Chickowski, 2020).

It's critical to keep track of who has access to the data. Understanding who requires access to what and granting appropriate permissions to users without raising their privileges until absolutely necessary would present issues for the hacker. (National Cyber security centre, N.D).
If the packets are incorrect, an IP packet filter can effectively reject transmission. IDS is also a necessary tool since it provides for many safeguards, such as legitimate signature recognition and detection of anomalous network activity. IDS allows you to filter the protocols that are utilized on the network. (Juniper, N.D).
In conclusion, it is necessary to implement good practices to protect against external attacks. It is not needed to spend a lot of money to protect against attacks. Setting up an unsecured network can cost more money and damage the credibility of the company in the event of an attack than if adequate protection had been put in place in the first place.

										In the second case study we discussed about was the Sheldon Investment Limited case, this firm violated the GDPR, notably in the use of email addresses for marketing purposes despite the fact that the individual involved had specified that they did not wish to receive marketing emails.
Despite complaints to Sheldon Investement Limited, the individual continued to receive marketing emails a year later, resulting in a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner. As a result, the Dublin Metropolitan District Court issued a fine and costs for "marketing email without authorization" and the case study.
This was a human error, according to Sheldon Investment Limited. This type of problem might be caused by a lack of sight. When a client requests that their email address be removed from the database, the email address may be stored in several databases, resulting in inaccuracies when Sheldon Investment Limited certifies that the email has been removed.
Manual entry might lead to a considerable rise in mistakes. If a user chooses to opt out of receiving marketing emails, it is better to update the information for that person automatically to avoid mistakes. If setting up an automated system isn't practicable, data governance allows you to select particular individuals to do this type of work. (Stephens, N.D).
