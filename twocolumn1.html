											<h2>Individual Reflection</h2>
											<h3>Dario De Giorgi</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I come from a technical rather than a literary background, I have chosen cyber security as a subject that interests me and I would therefore like to choose a thesis subject that would allow me to develop my skills both technically and in terms of research.
I think that during this module the key elements that will allow me to advance in my research concerning my thesis are undoubtedly the ways of doing research, whether quantitative or qualitative, indeed I did not know these two methodologies, the qualitative approach could be useful in order to gain depth in the analysis of the final subject, in the other hand the quantitative research will allow to see the evolution within a project according to the data collected.
Regarding how to formulate and choose the title of the thesis, I would like to choose the title "What are the limits of an automated defence system for cyber security? I think my thesis research meets all the criteria asked, clear, focused, complex, feasible and hypothesis.
I also understood in this module how to manage my time during the research work, I think I will establish daily tasks according to my set objectives, rigorously organise what I have to do and make a list of tasks using a software to manage my time. My idea would be to set priorities to follow with deadlines according to the objectives.

											<table style="width:100%">
											  <tr>
											    <th>What do I want/need to learn?
Provide a specific description of the desired changes (e.g. skills to gain, knowledge to acquire, topics/themes/content to cover)
</th>
											    <th>What do I have to do to achieve this?
Some examples, a new/ongoing course, conference, self-development (like wider research or reading), coaching/mentoring, job shadowing
</th>
											    <th>What resources or support will I need?
Some examples, teaching staff support, library support, student advisor support, line manager, etc.
</th>
<th>How will I measure success?
Some examples, appraisals, course assessments, team feedback, tutor feedback
</th>
<th>Target dates for review and completion
Note that these need to be realistic/achievable

											    <td>I would like to take advantage of the research in the field of Automated Defense System for Cybersecurity, to increase my knowledge in this field and also to put into practice the documentation found in a lab.</td>
											    <td>To achieve my goal, I think I need to diversify my research and select the best tool to defend a system and then simulate attacks to prove its effectiveness.</td>
											    <td>I think I will need support on a technical level if I have questions about the practical part of the final thesis and also questions about the methodology I am going to adopt, to see if it is the right one.</td>
											    <td>I think the feedback from the tutor will be an important element to see the success of my final work.</td>
											    <td> As far as the final work is concerned, I think that the research part with the research methodology will take place during 1 month, then the information will be collected, the practical part will be implemented during about 1 month as well. The writing by gathering the research and the practical part will be done during 4 months and the last month will be reserved for the setting up of the presentation. </td>
